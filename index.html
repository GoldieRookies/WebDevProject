          I have been starting to code ever since the start
          of quarantine as I had a lot of free time on my
          hands. I've been joining the app development club
          using unity and computer science club in the Waterloo
          CCC and CCO contest. I've also learned how to create
          websites like these so then I can showcase my skills.

          I started playing the violin when I was 9 years old and used to like
          to play it for a little while before I started losing interest doing
          private lessons. I quit for around a year and then in grade 9, I
          started playing violin a lot and go to Markville Secondary School
          Symphonic Strings

          This is a sport that I like to play. I started
          playing when I was 10 years old and I used to not be very
          interested in it. But as I got better,
          it has become my favorite pass time.

          I also do air cadets as I like to have the opportunity
